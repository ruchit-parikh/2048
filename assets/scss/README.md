# SCSS

Generated css files will be put in the css directory. Only main.css file will be used in web pages.

## Developer Notes:

> **Note:**  We use strict coding standards, clean codes and well formed directory structures. Kindly follow same if you contribute to this project.

1. Use 2 spaces for each of your block.
2. If a variable name contains more than one word, use '-' to separate both words. Store variables in only _variables.scss file.
3. Make sure you separate components with their own directory which contains mixins, functions related only with that component like buttons, forms etc.
4. Put common mixins and functions in _mixins.scss and _functions.scss of root scss directory.
